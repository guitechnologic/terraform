File Provisioner
The file provisioner copies files or directories from the machine running Terraform to the newly created resource. The file provisioner supports both ssh and winrm type connections.

Important: Use provisioners as a last resort. There are better alternatives for most situations. Refer to Declaring Provisioners for more details.
